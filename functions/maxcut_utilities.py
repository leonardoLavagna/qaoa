# maxcut_utilities.py
#
# This module provides utility functions for the MaxCut problem [1], including 
# exact computation of the MaxCut, inverting dictionary keys, calculating the 
# number of edges in a MaxCut for a given node assignment, and computing the 
# energy of the MaxCut hamiltonian from measurement counts.
#
# Functions included:
# - compute_max_cut_exactly(G): Computes the maximum cut value of a graph using 
#   a brute-force approach.
# - invert_counts(counts): Inverts the keys of a dictionary.
# - get_maxcut_number_of_edges(G, x): Calculates the number of edges in the 
#   maximum cut of a graph for a given node assignment.
# - compute_maxcut_energy(G, counts, verbose): Computes the energy of the 
#   maximum cut for a given graph and measurement counts.
#
# These utilities are designed to work with graphs created using the Problems 
# class and are intended to assist with the implementation and evaluation of 
# the QAOA algorithm for the MaxCut problem.
